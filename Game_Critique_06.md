# Final Thoughts
The turing test is a game remomended for those who enjoy puuzle adventure games, similuar to valve's "Portal" series. The gradually increases the complexlity and challenge for each puzzles as you progress through each set of puzzles. Additionallty typlicly near the middle of each seaction, challenge rooms are made aviable to players that want to slove a harder pluzzle based on what tools you have learn to use. Upon completing these the player is reward with an achievement/ Trophie, and is given more exposistion about the story. This is a nice incentive to those who really want to know more about the story, giving a worth while reward without forcing them on the player. 

However baised on my experience some of these "Challenge Levels", could have required more out of the box thinking from the player. Most of these Challenge levels can have you stumped for awhile, after trying multipule ways to reach the goal. Only to realize the solution was right in front of you. The turing test is a puzzle game with platforming elements, finding creative ways to provide the player with more reasons to do the bonus puzzles. Rather than compeleting them for the sake of completion.
